                                <h2>About the project</h2>
                      
                                <p> Algorithmic approaches are currently being introduced in many areas of
                                human activity and architecture is no exception. However, designing with
                                algorithms is a foreign concept to many and the inadequacy of current
                                programming environments creates a barrier to the generalized adoption of
                                Algorithmic Design (AD). The Khepri.gh project aims to provide architects
                                with a programming tool they feel comfortable with, while allowing them to
                                fully benefit from AD&#39;s advantages in the creation of complex architectural
                                models.
                                <br /> 
                                Khepri.gh is a hybrid solution that combines Grasshopper, a visual
                                programming environment, with Khepri, a flexible and scalable textual
                                programming tool. Khepri.gh establishes a bridge between the visual and the
                                textual paradigm, offering its users the best of both worlds while providing
                                an extra set of advantages, including portability among CAD, BIM, and
                                analysis tools.

                        <h2>Implementation and Features</h2>

                        <p> Khepri.gh&#39;s implementation is in many ways similar to Grasshopper&#39;s currently
                        available textual scripting editors: (A) users drag a blank Khepri component
                        onto the canvas, (B) open up the editor box by double-clicking a component
                        and develop Julia code within; (C) they can then save the new components
                        onto a dedicated tab.
                        </p>

                        <div class="row"><div class="1u 12u"></div>
                        <div class="10u 12u"> 
                            <a href="kheprigh/basics.png" class="image
                            featured"><img src="kheprigh/basics.png" alt="" title="Khepri.gh&#39;s
                            implementation"></a>
                            </div></div>
                        
                        <p> However, while Grasshopper&#39;s C\#, VB, and Python scripting editors only
                        provide the features of each programming language unless other libraries are
                        loaded, our implementation not only integrates the Julia language but also
                        the Khepri programming tool from the start. This means, that besides the
                        language primitives, users have access to the modeling primitives available
                        in Khepri, which are transversal to the multiple backends.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Traceability</h3>

                        <p>Traceability entails the identification of which parts of the model
                        correspond to which parts of the program, and vice-versa, a crucial
                        correlation to understand, maintain, and debug the program. Khepri.gh
                        maintains Grasshopper&#39;s unidirectional traceability, relating program
                        components to model elements but across multiple backends.
                        </p>
                         
                        <a href="kheprigh/traceability.png" class="image
                            featured"><img src="kheprigh/traceability.png" alt="" title="Traceability"/></a>
                        <br />

                        <h3>Immediate Feedback</h3>

                        <p>Immediate feedback is the ability to re-compute changes to the program&#39;s
                        input or to the program itself in (near) real time, allowing designers to
                        easily understand the program&#39;s behavior. Grasshopper immediately updates
                        the geometry upon adding/changing components, Boolean toggles or sliders.
                        Khepri.gh extends this feature to the various backends but performance must
                        be taken into consideration when dealing with complex models. Scale is
                        already an issue for Grasshopper&#39;s optimized preview mode (i.e., non-baked
                        geometry); even more so for Khepri.gh, which has to generate the geometry in
                        the backends, a somewhat equivalent process to baking. This process is
                        considerably faster in more performative backends, such as game engines, or
                        using CAD tool&#39;s more performative view options, such as wireframe models.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Code editing options</h3>

                        <p>Khepri.gh supports different code editing options. In the visual
                        programming environment, the user can (A) manipulate existing Grasshopper
                        components and (B) create new Khepri components, each one representing a
                        parcel of code, using the textual programming editor available within
                        Grasshopper. However, for more lengthier components, (C) the code can also
                        be accessed in a textual programming editor, such as Atom by right clicking
                        a component and choosing the ‘Khepri code&#39; option.
                        </p>

                        <a href="kheprigh/code_options.png" class="image
                        featured"><img src="kheprigh/code_options.png" alt="" title="Code editing options"/></a>
                        <br />

                        <h3>No Repetition</h3>

                        <p>Following Grasshopper&#39;s native structure, VB, C\# or Python components
                        motivate the construction of standalone components which both implement and
                        execute operations. When reusing such components, the code is essentially
                        duplicated and further changes to that structure must be performed in all
                        similar components. Textual programming follows a different logic, where
                        repetition is avoided at all costs for logic and organizational purposes.
                        This makes the code structure more comprehensible and manageable, sparing
                        the user the time-consuming and error-prone task of maintaining several
                        versions of the same functionality. 
                        <br /><br />
                        Khepri.gh follows the textual logic in this issue, introducing a
                        fundamental separation between function definitions and function calls.
                        All components on canvas are processed on demand, with or without
                        inputs, with or without specific modeling instructions. Users may gather
                        function definitions, in one or more components, that can be used in all
                        the others that call them, thus eliminating repeated definitions. When
                        the user edits a definition component, the changes will have automatic
                        repercussions in any other components dependent upon this one.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Complexity</h3>

                        <p>The scalability issue inherent to visual programming languages affects
                        many of the features that make these systems so appealing to users in
                        earlier stages: both immediate feedback and program readability are
                        compromised as complexity increases. For the first issue, Grasshopper
                        cleverly offers a solution unsurprisingly inspired in the way textual
                        programming languages deal with geometry generation: inputting numbers
                        directly onto sliders instead of dragging them, or even disabling the solver
                        as we edit the program, thus significantly reducing the number of times the
                        model is recomputed. 
                        <br /><br /> For the second problem, the most obvious solution is
                        abstraction: the possibility to encapsulate complex computations in much
                        simpler program structures, such as recursive and iterative first-order or
                        higher-order functions. These mechanisms allow the development of more
                        complex programs without resorting to the repetition of instructions.
                        However, most visual programming languages, including Grasshopper, do not
                        (directly) support these functionalities. Since Khepri.gh is built on top of
                        the Julia language, any Julia functionality can be used from Grasshopper as
                        well, meaning that the data that flows between components includes not only
                        basic data structures, such as numbers and positions, but also functions,
                        arrays, tuples, dictionaries, etc., and arbitrary combinations of these.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Save Khepri components</h3>

                        <p> Go to <i>File</i> > <i>Create User Object</i>, then select the component
                        you want to save. You may change the name, nickname, description, and icon
                        if you want. Saved components will be available in the <i>User</i>
                        tab.

                        <h3>Symbology within components</h3>

                        <p>        <code>&#60;</code> is used to define component&#39;s input variables
                            <br /> <code>></code> is used to define the component&#39;s output variables
                            <br /> <code>=</code> is used to define variables within the component
                            much like in Julia
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Anything to the <b>left</b> of these symbols will be interpreted by
                            Julia as <i>variable names</i>, which can be used only within the scope of the
                            particular component they are defined in (exception made to the
                            <i>Definitions Component</i>, which we will be explained later on).
                            <br />
                            To the <b>right</b> of the symbol, Khepri.gh expects you to provide a
                            <i>TypeFunction</i> with the information required to identify (1) the
                            type of data being handled and (2) the information Grasshopper needs on
                            the names and descriptions attributed to each of the component&#39;s inputs
                            and outputs.
                            <br />
                            <br /> Note: If you intend to output a value/expression that is not a
                            variable within the component, you can directly provide the corresponding
                            value/expression to the output symbol. You may also use
                            <code>_</code> before the output symbol, thus providing no explicit
                            expression for the output. This will be considered an anonymous variable
                            and the component will output the result of the last computation made
                            within it. Only works properly for one output. 
                          

                            <br /><br /> <b>Abstract examples:</b>

                            <br />
                            <code>variable_a &#60; VariableType()</code> is an input.
                            <br />
                            <code>variable_b = &#60;variable value/expression></code> can be used
                            within the component.
                            <br />
                            <code>(variable_c,variable_d) = &#60;variable value(s)/expression(s)></code> 
                            exemplifies a definition using tuples.
                            <br />
                            <code>variable_b > VariableType()</code> is an output.
                            <br />
                            <code>&#60;variable value/expression> > VariableType()</code> is a
                            direct output with no variable name associated to it within the
                            component.
                            <br />
                            <code>_ > VariableType()</code> is an output with no expression provided
                            directly. The result of the last computation made within the component
                            will be outputted.
                        </p>

<pre><code>
    # Title 
    # v &#60; Type("Input", "I", "I Parameter", default)
    a &#60; Number()
    b &#60; Number()
    _ > Number()
    sqrt(a^2 + b^2)   

</code></pre>
<br />
                        <p> The first line will be used as the component&#39;s <b>title</b> by default. You may
                        ignore this and edit the title later by double clicking on the component and
                        changing the name field. If you want to define the title in the editor using the first line, do
                        not forget to comment it (using <code>#</code>) since within the component all characters
                        are read as code.

                        <code>v</code> exemplifies the information the user is supposed to provide

                        None of these arguments are mandatory. If no arguments are provided, the
                        system will use defaults for everything. If only the name argument is
                        provided, the system will infer the nickname (capitalized first letter of
                        the name), the description ("&#60;nickname> parameter"), and the default
                        value, as exemplified below with parameters a, b, and _. Users may also
                        provide only one numeric/default argument corresponding to the
                        initialization value.

                        <b>Number(s(s)), Integer(s(s)), Point(s(s)), Vector(s(s)), String(s(s)), Boolean(s(s)),
                        Path(s(s))</b>
                        <br /> <br />
                        For the 7 basic types there is a direct correspondence between Julia and
                        Grasshopper. This means you can input and output them at will, interchanging
                        data between the two programming languages, whilst Khepri automatically
                        converts from one end to the other as needed.
                        <br /> <br />
                        <b>Eval(s(s))</b>
                        <br /> <br />
                        Eval deals with any Julia expression provided as a sting – these may come
                        from a Grasshopper panel (no quotation marks needed! The panel produces a
                        string) or from another Khepri component (with eval/evals as an output).
                        Eval evaluates the given expression as Julia code. The result will be a
                        value in Julia. 
                        <br /> <br />
                        <b>Any/Many/Manies</b>
                        <br /> <br />
                        To output the result of Julia calculation within a Khepri component for
                        Grasshopper, you can use any of 7 basic types: the output can be used to
                        feed Grasshopper components as Khepri covers everything in the background.
                        <br /> 
                        If you do not know what the result of the computation will be yet (could be
                        one of multiple types depending on the input), choose the Any/Many type
                        instead. Khepri will dynamically try to match the type of the result to any
                        of the 7 basic types. If it fails (meaning, none of the types apply) it will
                        simply return a pointer (much like the result of the JL type).
                        <br /> 
                        Attention: this type cannot be initialized within the component, meaning it
                        cannot have a default.
                        <br /> <br />
                        <b>JL(s(s))</b>
                        <br /> <br />
                        Data types only Julia can process. There is no correspondent representation
                        in Grasshopper. Hence, Khepri will return a pointer (memory). You may
                        visualize the pointer using a Grasshopper panel, but you may not operate on
                        it using Grasshopper components, only Khepri&#39;s. Examples include functions,
                        shapes, etc.

                        <h3>&#x26A0; Notes for debugging</h3>

                        <p> &#x2022; Code written in components is more efficient than using panels and Eval
                        types (although the latter is more visually appealing), because everything is
                        compiled on a first read. Panels being inputted onto an Eval must recompile
                        all the time. this is a time vs. beauty tradeoff.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Definitions Component</h3>

                        <p> Components with no inputs or outputs are treated differently (like text
                        files) – use them for definitions only, no geometry generation. This one
                        forces the recomputation of all the others, because it does not know which
                        other components depend on it. The other types of components only force
                        recomputation on their node/wire chain.</p>
